# DNB UI Library - HTML UMD Bundle Example

This example uses [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to start a local server with live reload, serving the static files. But the **index.html** can also be opened without any server as well as long as the package `dnb-ui-lib` is setup correctly.

## Dependencies

To run the ui-lib [React and React-Dom](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react) is required as an external dependency. Have a look at the **index.html** file.

## Start the live-server

To run the HTML page, You have to run a `live-server`.

1. Simply install the package dependencies
1. Run `yarn start` for a live reload server - or simply open the **index.html** file from the _static_ folder.
1. Open this location in Your browser: `http://localhost:8080`
